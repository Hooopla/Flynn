Hi! My name’s Gabriel Bello, and I’m currently studying Computer Systems at Simon Fraser University. I first got into Front-End Development through my CMPT 225 project, Dish It, which really sparked my passion for building things. Lately, I’ve also developed a huge interest in A.I & Machine Learning, and I’m excited to keep exploring that field!

I’m a big fan of all kinds of food, and I’d definitely call myself a project person whether it’s cars, hardware, or software, I love staying busy and learning new things. In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my partner and friends, whether we’re window shopping, gaming, watching movies, or catching a Vancouver Canucks game (the SportsBar at Rogers Arena is definitely my go-to spot!).
