My name’s Gabriel Bello, and I’m currently studying Computer Systems at Simon Fraser University. I first got into Front-End Development through my CMPT 225 project, Dish It, which really sparked my passion for building things. Lately, I’ve also developed a huge interest in A.I & Machine Learning, and I’m excited to keep exploring that field!\\n\\nI’m a big fan of all kinds of food, and I’d definitely call myself a project person whether it’s cars, hardware, or software, I love staying busy and learning new things. In my spare time, I enjoy hanging out with my partner and friends, whether we’re window shopping, gaming, watching movies, or catching a Vancouver Canucks game (the SportsBar at Rogers Arena is definitely my go-to spot!).\\n\\n##LinkedIn Profile:\\n\\xa0 \\xa0\\nContact\\njohngabrielbello@gmail.com\\nwww.linkedin.com/in/\\njohngabrielbello (LinkedIn)\\nTop Skills\\nWeb Development\\nTransmission Control Protocol (TCP)\\nReact.js\\nGabriel Bello\\nHardware Technician at BC Tech For Learning Society\\nBurnaby, British Columbia, Canada\\nSummary\\nHi I'm Gab, a Computer Science student at the Simon Fraser\\nUniversity.\\nI enjoy everything I put my time into which includes but not limited to:\\nplaying soccer, competing in professional E-Sports events, skating,\\noutdoors activities, and of course, software development!\\nI am currently interning as a Hardware Technician @ BC-Tech For\\nLearning while putting time aside to learn AI Machine Learning as I\\nhave found an interest in this topic as of recent :D\\nExperience\\nBC Technology for Learning Society\\nHardware Technician\\nSeptember 2025\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(2 months)\\nBurnaby, British Columbia, Canada\\n- Troubleshot, repaired, and tested over 200 donated devices monthly,\\nachieving a 98% functionality rate.\\n- Managed the refurbishment and quality control process for 150+ outgoing\\ncomputers, ensuring 100% compliance with quality standards.\\n- Refurbished and cleaned 100+ computers, laptops, printers, servers, and\\nLCDs weekly, ensuring optimal\\nfunctionality and extending device lifespan.\\nIndigo\\nOperations\\nMay 2022\\xa0-\\xa0Present\\xa0(3 years 6 months)\\nBurnaby, British Columbia, Canada\\n- Conduct inventory cycle counts, replenish stock, manage product returns,\\nand process incoming store orders, ensuring accurate inventory levels and\\nefficient handling of over 2,500+ units per week.\\n\\xa0 Page 1 of 2\\xa0 \\xa0\\n- Assist with on-boarding and training employees on internal IT systems,\\nensuring smooth adoption of digital tools and compliance with company\\nprocedures\\nTwitch\\nSocial Media Manager\\nJanuary 2021\\xa0-\\xa0April 2022\\xa0(1 year 4 months)\\nBurnaby, British Columbia, Canada\\n- Reviewed and analyzed data to enhance channel traction, achieving\\nengagement increases ranging from 86% to 267% by collecting data samples\\nfrom different days, analyzing viewership algorithms, and tracking trends using\\ndetailed notes and spreadsheets to optimize content and increase audience\\nengagement.\\n- Facilitated collaboration between different media brands, companies, and\\nchannels, and supported the process of securing sponsorship and organizing\\nevents.\\n- Conducted one-on-one meetings with 20+ clients to address concerns and\\nprovide personalized support.\\nPlaces Des Arts\\nIT Systems Administrator\\nMay 2019\\xa0-\\xa0July 2021\\xa0(2 years 3 months)\\nCoquitlam, British Columbia, Canada\\n- Managed and maintained IT systems, including user accounts, software\\nupdates, and troubleshooting\\nhardware/software issues to ensure seamless operations.\\n- Ensured data integrity and accuracy by conducting data-entry of client\\nrecords and cross-reference with attendance logs.\\nEducation\\nSimon Fraser University\\n\\xa0·\\xa0(2020\\xa0-\\xa02025)\\nBurnaby South Secondary School\\nHigh School Diploma\\xa0\\xa0·\\xa0(September 2015\\xa0-\\xa0June 2020)\\n\\xa0 Page 2 of 2\\n\\n##Projects:\\nProject Title: Land-Grab\\nProject Link: https://github.com/Hooopla/Land-Grab\\nDescription: Land Grab is a grid based game where a total of 3 players will have to beat one another by claiming the largest region with the most cells.

Once a region is claimed, it becomes locked, which then prevents other players from selecting it.
